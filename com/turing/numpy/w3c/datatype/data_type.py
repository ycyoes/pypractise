'''
By default Python have these data types:

    strings - used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. e.g. "ABCD"
    integer - used to represent integer numbers. e.g. -1, -2, -3
    float - used to represent real numbers. e.g. 1.2, 42.42
    boolean - used to represent True or False.
    complex - used to represent complex numbers. e.g. 1.0 + 2.0j, 1.5 + 2.5j

NumPy has some extra data types, and refer to data types with one character, like i for integers, u for unsigned integers etc.

Below is a list of all data types in NumPy and the characters used to represent them.

    i - integer
    b - boolean
    u - unsigned integer
    f - float
    c - complex float
    m - timedelta
    M - datetime
    O - object
    S - string
    U - unicode string
    V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )

#Create an array with data type string
arr1 = np.array([1,2,3,4], dtype='S')
print(arr1)
